# readmeGenerator

## Description

My motivation for building this application was to reduce the production time, when it comes to writting READMEs. My reasoning was Because it can be difficult to write READMEs when you don't know where to start. The problem like this application solves It gives you a fully 
functioning README generator With questions to help plan out the 
structure. What i learned throughout this project was how to effectively use advance ES6 skills such as inquirer, require, node and many more.
